# note_taker

## Description
This project allows the user to write notes that are then stored into the database. It is a simple note taker application but is very useful.  You can title and make a description on each note. 

## Installation and Usage
To use this, the user must do 'npm i' to install the packages. Afterwards, running 'node server.js' will launch the server. The user can then go to the local host URL to use the application.

## Contributing
Joshua Davis and I worked on this entire project together. We are married and collaborated on it.
